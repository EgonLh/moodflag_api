# Mood Swing Prediction API and Streamlit Web App

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, mental health challenges like mood swings often go unnoticed or undiagnosed, leading to severe consequences for individuals' well-being. While professional care is essential, early detection using accessible and non-invasive methods can help people become more aware of their mental state and seek support when necessary. This project aims to provide a lightweight, AI-powered solution that predicts mood swing tendencies based on survey-style inputs, making it easier to monitor and reflect on mental health.

## Project Overview

- A **FastAPI-based RESTful API** for making predictions.
- A **Streamlit web application** for users to interact with the model via a simple UI.

## Features

- Input form for mental health and lifestyle-related data
- Real-time mood swing prediction
- Simple API to connect front-end and back-end

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- Joblib
